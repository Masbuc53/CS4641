Once all of the python files and data have been downloaded, only one manual
interaction with the data is required. Simply perform the following mapping with
the labels in tripadvisor_review.csv:

Category 1 -> Art Galleries
Category 2 -> Dance Clubs
Category 3 -> Juice Bars
Category 4 -> Restaurants
Category 5 -> Museums
Category 6 -> Resorts
Category 7 -> Parks/Picnic Spots
Category 8 -> Beaches
Category 9 -> Theaters
Category 10 -> Religious Institutions

After this has been performed, you can run each of the python files in the
command line by typing python ./FILENAME.
