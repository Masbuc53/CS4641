Stanley "Mason" Buchanan
CS 4641 Assignment 4

I utilized Juan Jose's code as it had all of the functionality necessary to complete this assignment.
This code can be found at https://github.com/juanjose49/omscs-cs7641-machine-learning-assignment-4. 

The only alterations I made to his code was changing the gridworlds and reward structures.
These can be altered in the HardGridWorldLauncher.java and EasyGridWorldLauncher.java files
as well as the BasicRewardFunction.java file. Since my alterations were trivial, I will not
be uploading my changes.

Once any alterations you want to make are completed, simply follow the instructions provided in the 
README on Juan Jose's github, as they are relatively straightforward. 

For details on the results of my experiments, you can view them in the Results documents found at
https://github.com/Masbuc53/CS4641/tree/master/Assignment4.
